    * Cancel or Refund a Payment (SOAP)
    *
    * If you do not know if the payment is captured but you want to reverse the authorisation you can send a modification
    * request to the cancelOrRefund action. This file shows how a payment can be cancelled or refunded by a modification
    * request using SOAP.
    *
    * Please note: using our API requires a web service user. Set up your Webservice user:
    * Adyen CA >> Settings >> Users >> ws@Company. >> Generate Password >> Submit
