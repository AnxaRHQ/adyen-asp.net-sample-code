    * Capture a Payment (SOAP)
    *
    * Authorised (card) payments can be captured to get the money from the shopper. Payments can be automatically captured
    * by our platform. A payment can also be captured by performing an API call. In order to capture an authorised (card)
    * payment you have to send a modification request. This file shows how an authorised payment should be captured by
    * sending a modification request using SOAP.
    *
    * Please note: using our API requires a web service user. Set up your Webservice user:
    * Adyen CA >> Settings >> Users >> ws@Company. >> Generate Password >> Submit
