    * Decline Payout Request (SOAP)
    *
    * Confirming and declining the Payout can be done via a webservice call to the Payout Service or manually via the
    * Customer Area (CA). This example shows how a Payout request can be declined using SOAP.
    *
    * Please note: the Payout functionality is set up as a 2-step process. Because of this there are two additional
    * Webservice User accounts needed to use the Payout process. Please request the Payout permission for a specific user
    * account with Adyen Support. The password can be set in Adyen CA >> Settings >> Users.
